# udpreplay

udpreplay is a tool to replays UDP packets from a pcap dump.

Unlike [tcpreplay](http://tcpreplay.appneta.com/), it only replays the payload
and not the headers, so it does not require root privileges and works fine with
the Linux loopback device.

It supports rate control, either in packets per second or bits per second.
It does support replay with the original timings.

The packets are pre-loaded from the pcap file, so it is possible to send at a
higher rate than the packets can be loaded. Typically, the NIC or the kernel
limits the maximum rate.

## udpcount

An extra tool is included, called `udpcount`. It listens for UDP packets on a
socket, and reports statistics about the number of bytes and packets received
once per second.

## Requirements

You will need libpcap (including development headers), Boost headers, and the
libraries for the Boost `system` and `program_options` libraries. You will
also need a modern C++11-capable compiler. GCC 4.8 and Clang 3.4 are known to
work.

## Installation

udpcount uses the standard autoconf/automake flow for installation. If you
are installing from a git checkout, you should first run `./bootstrap.sh`.
After that, it is the usual process of
```sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

## Usage

First, capture a file using [tcpdump](http://www.tcpdump.org/) or whichever
tool you prefer. Only ethernet frame types are currently supported (which
includes the Linux loopback device). Then to replay it at 100Mbps, run

```sh
udpreplay --mbps 100 capture.pcap
```

Run `udpreplay -h` to see a list of other options. A particularly useful
option on Linux is `--mode sendmmsg`, which can increase performance.

## Infiniband Verbs API

If your NIC supports the Infiniband Verbs API, you may be able to get higher
performance by using it. It will be automatically detected at configure time.

There are some caveats. It can only be used with multicast destination
addresses, and you must specify the interface to use by passing
`--bind <ip-address>`.
